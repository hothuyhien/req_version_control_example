# Parent Engagement Functionality Documentation - Version 1.0

## Overview
The Parent Engagement Functionality in the MindX LMS is designed to provide a streamlined communication channel between parents and teachers. This feature allows parents to easily track their children's academic progress and receive updates from teachers.

## Features

### Parent-Role Accounts
Parents are provided with accounts that allow them to log in to the system and view their children's information. This includes:

- Grades: Parents can view their children's grades for each subject.
- Attendance: Parents can check their children's attendance records.
- Test Reviews: Parents can read reviews of their children's tests.
- Teacher Evaluations: Parents can view evaluations provided by teachers.

### Email Notifications
The system sends email notifications to parents in the following scenarios:

- End of Class: Parents receive an email when a class ends, providing a summary of what was covered in the class.
- Teacher/Teaching Assistant Comments: When a teacher or teaching assistant adds comments about a class, parents receive an email with these comments.

### Educational Alerts
The system automatically sends educational alerts via email to parents and students when a studentâ€™s learning process deviates from the norm. This includes scenarios such as excessive absences or low grades.

## Future Enhancements
In future versions, we plan to add more features to further enhance the parent engagement functionality. We welcome feedback and suggestions from users to help us improve this feature.
